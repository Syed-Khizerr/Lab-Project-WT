                    As a Faculty Data Collector at CBIT (Chaitanya Bharathi Institute of Technology), I am dedicated to supporting the academic and administrative functions of the institution by systematically gathering, organizing, and analyzing crucial faculty data. My role involves collecting detailed information about faculty members' academic qualifications, teaching assignments, research contributions, professional development activities, and performance evaluations. By maintaining accurate and up-to-date records, I contribute to enhancing faculty effectiveness, streamlining reporting processes, and ensuring compliance with accreditation standards. Through these efforts, I aim to empower CBIT in fostering an environment of excellence in education and research.
